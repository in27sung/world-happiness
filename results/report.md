## Project Report: Predicting Country-Level Happiness Scores

### Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between countries' happiness scores and key economic and social indicators. It aims to build a robust predictive model while addressing data quality challenges such as missing values and inconsistent formatting. The output includes complete data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, evaluation, and interpretation.

### Dataset Description
The dataset combines multiple global indicators for 130 countries, including:
- **Year:** The year for which the data is recorded(2015-2023)
- **Country:** The name of the country.
- **GDP_per_capita:** Gross Domestic Product per capita, which is a measure of a country's economic outout per person.
- **Education_Attainment:** Percentage of the population aged 25 and older who have completed at least a bachelorâ€™s degree or equivalent tertiary education.  
- **Life_Expectancy:** The average number of years a person is expected to live.
- **Unemployment_Rate:** The percentage of the labour force that is unemployed.
- **Happiness Score(target):** A metric measuring the self-reported happiness of individuals in a country.

### Data Preprocessing
- Data Reshaping
- Removing Non-Country Entries for Dataset Integrity
- Removing Country Mismatches Against 2023 Target Set
- Standardising Country Names Across Datasets for Reliable Merging

#### Cleaning Steps(Chat GPT)
- **Education_Attainment**:
  - Missing values filled using **country-wise median**.
  - Remaining nulls filled with **overall median**.

- **Life_Expectancy**:
  - Applied **country-wise linear interpolation**.
  - Remaining missing values filled with **overall mean**.
- Final dataset contains **no missing values**.

- Outputs:
  - `gpt_merged_dataset.csv`

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
![2023 Life Expactancy Missingness](/images/2023_life_expactancy_missingness.png)

- **GDP per capita** shows a **strong positive correlation** with **Happiness Score** (linear trend observed).
- **Impact of Life Expectancy Missingness on Happiness Score**
  - Countries **missing Life Expectancy data** in 2023 showed **significantly lower average Happiness Scores** (mean â‰ˆ 5.24) compared to those with available data (mean â‰ˆ 6.66).
  - Countries with available 2023 life expectancy data tend to report higher minimum happiness scores and tighter variance, implying they may be technologically advanced or more transparent.
  - Although the mean happiness score is clearly lower for countries with missing life expectancy data, the imbalance in group size (103 vs 28) suggests caution in interpreting statistical differences.
  - The absence of data in other countries might not directly reflect poor life expectancy, but could stem from limited data infrastructure, delayed reporting cycles, or geopolitical factors.
- Identified a few **outlier countries** with **low GDP per capita but high Happiness Score** â€” flagged for further qualitative analysis.
- Visualised trends using **scatter plots**, **pairplots**, and **correlation heatmaps** for cross-feature relationship assessment.

#### Post Cleaning Steps

- **Lebanon (2023) GDP per capita** manually set to **3350** (source: [TradingEconomics](https://tradingeconomics.com/lebanon/gdp-per-capita-us-dollar-wb-data.html)).
- Applied **country-wise linear interpolation** for:
  - `Education_Attainment`
  - `Life_Expectancy`
- No global imputation needed after interpolation.
- Final dataset contains **no missing values**.
- Outputs:
  - `merged_dataset_v1.1.csv` (manual fix)
  - `merged_interpolated.csv` (interpolated version)

### Modelling
#### ðŸ“Œ Model: RandomForestRegressor
- Trained on cleaned dataset, using features from 2023 for final test.
- Feature Importance: GDP > Life Expectancy > Unemployment > Education

#### Performance Comparison
1. **Model A**: Trained on the dataset with missing values filled with ChatGPT.

2. **Model B**: Trained on the interpolated dataset using country-wise time-series imputation.
![test 2023 interpolation](/images/test_2023_interpolation.png)

- **No overfitting observed**: Validation and Test performance are consistent.
- RÂ² ~0.8 indicates **strong predictive power**.

---

### Conclusion & Insights

- The model successfully predicts national happiness based on quantifiable indicators.
- Cleaned data greatly improved predictive performance (compared to RÂ² ~0.6 on unoptimised data).
- Results suggest that **economic strength, education, and health indicators** are key drivers of national happiness.
- However, the model shows a tendency to **underestimate happiness scores for low-GDP countries**, indicating **an over-reliance on GDP-related features**.
- This highlights the need for **further feature engineering** to incorporate non-economic factorsâ€”such as cultural, social, or environmental elementsâ€”especially for economically weaker nations, to better capture the multifaceted nature of happiness.

### Feature Importance
![Feature Importance](/images/Feature_Importance_interpolation.png)
#### Feature Importance Analysis
- The model heavily depends on **GDP per capita** (`importance = 0.676`), far outweighing other features such as:
  - Life Expectancy (`0.19`)
  - Unemployment Rate and Education Attainment (each ~`0.06`)
- This **strong GDP dominance** in feature weighting confirms a **structural bias**: the model learns to associate happiness primarily with economic strength.

#### Hypothesised Causes of Underestimation:
- **Feature bias**: Overweighting of GDP leads to undervaluing happiness in countries where non-economic factors matter more.
- **Incomplete data**: Low-income nations often have more missing values, leading to less informative or averaged inputs.
- **Sample imbalance**: High-GDP countries may be overrepresented in the training set, skewing the learned patterns.
- **Omitted variables**: Factors like **social trust**, **freedom**, **cultural values**, and **community resilience**â€”which contribute meaningfully to happinessâ€”are not currently modelled.

> In short, the model is accurate for high-GDP countries but systematically undervalues subjective well-being in lower-income contexts. **Expanding the feature space beyond economics is essential to build a fairer and more generalisable model.**

---

### Next Step

- Reduce **GDP-dominance bias** by integrating **non-economic predictors** such as social trust, freedom of choice, generosity, and perceived corruptionâ€”especially for underrepresented low-GDP countries.
- Incorporate **qualitative and geopolitical indicators** (e.g., governance quality, safety perception, civil liberties) to capture hidden dimensions of happiness.
- Perform **targeted feature engineering** informed by outlier analysis to uncover latent drivers in countries with **high happiness but low GDP**.
- Explore **region-specific models** or interaction terms to address structural differences in how happiness is formed across countries.
- Apply **clustering and temporal modelling** to detect evolving happiness dynamics and localised trends.
